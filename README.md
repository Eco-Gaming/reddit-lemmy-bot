# reddit-lemmy-bot

This is supposed to become a bot that will archive certain reddit posts to lemmy, including all comments.

It uses a modified version of [geddit](https://github.com/kaangiray26/geddit) to access data from Reddit.

## Roadmap
- fully translate geddit javascript file to typescript
- implement error handling
- reorganize files
- reddit manager class for logic to determine ie. which posts to download, gettings streams of more than 25 posts, etc.
- find out how to interface with lemmy
